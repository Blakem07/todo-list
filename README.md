# Todo-list Web App

## Description

A Todo-list web application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Created from a webpack template (https://github.com/Blakem07/webpack-template.git)

## Key Features

- Multiple Projects: Create and manage multiple projects to organize your todos.
- Dynamic Todos: Add todos with various properties like due date, priority, and notes.
- UI Interactions: View, edit, expand, and delete todos. Priorities are color-coded for easy management.
- Persistence: Uses localStorage to save and load todos even after the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Webpack
- localStorage API

The project is modularized to separate the application logic from the UI logic, making the code clean and easy to maintain. Iâ€™ve also used date-fns to help with date formatting and manipulation.
